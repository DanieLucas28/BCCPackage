#' Beta Control Charts
#'
#' The Beta Chart presents the control limits based on the Beta probability distribution.  It was can be used for monitoring fraction data from Binomial distribution as replacement of the p-Charts. The Beta Chart was applied for monitoring the variables in three real studies, and it was compared to the control limits with three schemes. The comparative analysis showed that: (i) Beta approximation to the Binomial distribution was more appropriate with values confined in the [0, 1]- interval; and (ii) the charts proposed were more sensitive to the average run length (ARL), in both in-control and out-of-control processes monitoring. The Beta Charts outperform the Shewhart control charts analyzed for monitoring fraction data.
#' @aliases bcc
#' @description Creates and displays a beta control chart using the specified data, sizes, and type.
#' This is the main function to use for generating control charts.
#' @export bcc

#' @param data A numeric vector of data values.
#' @param sizes An optional numeric vector of sample sizes. Required for type 1 charts.
#' @param type An integer representing the type of control chart. There are two possible types: \code{1} for discrete data and \code{2} for continuous data.
#' @param title An optional string for the plot title.
#' @return A plot of the beta control chart.
