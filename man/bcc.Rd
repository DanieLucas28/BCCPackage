\title{Beta Control Charts}
\usage{
bcc(data, sizes = NULL, type, title = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric vector of data values.}

\item{sizes}{An optional numeric vector of sample sizes. Required for type 1 charts.}

\item{type}{An integer representing the type of control chart. There are two possible types: \code{1} for discrete data and \code{2} for continuous data.}

\item{title}{An optional string for the plot title.}
}
\value{
A plot of the beta control chart.
}
\description{
Creates and displays a beta control chart using the specified data, sizes, and type.
This is the main function to use for generating control charts.
}
\details{
The Beta Chart presents the control limits based on the Beta probability distribution.  It was can be used for monitoring fraction data from Binomial distribution as replacement of the p-Charts. The Beta Chart was applied for monitoring the variables in three real studies, and it was compared to the control limits with three schemes. The comparative analysis showed that: (i) Beta approximation to the Binomial distribution was more appropriate with values confined in the \link{0, 1}- interval; and (ii) the charts proposed were more sensitive to the average run length (ARL), in both in-control and out-of-control processes monitoring. The Beta Charts outperform the Shewhart control charts analyzed for monitoring fraction data.
