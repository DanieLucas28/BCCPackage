Description: This package applies beta control charts to defined values. The Beta Chart presents control limits based on the Beta probability distribution, making it suitable for monitoring fraction data from a Binomial distribution as a replacement for p-Charts. The Beta Chart has been applied in three real studies and compared with control limits from three different schemes. The comparative analysis showed that: (i) the Beta approximation to the Binomial distribution is more appropriate for values confined within the [0, 1] interval; and (ii) the proposed charts are more sensitive to the average run length (ARL) in both in-control and out-of-control process monitoring. Overall, the Beta Charts outperform the Shewhart control charts in monitoring fraction data.
